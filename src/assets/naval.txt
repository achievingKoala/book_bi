1 Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.
2 Understand ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.
3 Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.
